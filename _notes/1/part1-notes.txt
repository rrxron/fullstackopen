default react tooling:  create-react-app
possible new tooling:  vite


using pnpm instead of npm:
>>pnpx create-react-app
>>pnpm start

react app runs at port 3000 by default

layout of react components are written using JSX (similar to Thymeleaf + Java Spring)
compilation is handled by Babel

components are a feature to enable for code reuseability and maintainability


passing data between components: props

component names should be in capitalcase

top level component needs to be contained in one root element

ideally, use fragments <></> on top level component to avoid an extra <div></div>

objects are not valid as a react child, you can't render objects
you need to retrieve the property values of the object instead

arrays can be rendered as long as it contains an array that are allowed to be rendered (numbers, strings, boolean, etc.)
