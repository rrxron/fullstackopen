when something is wrong, do not guess... use console.log() always

every looped element within a component needs a "key" attribute, example:

      <ul>
        {notes.map(note => <li key={note.id}>{note.content}</li>)}
      </ul>

the "key" attribute and it's value only exists within react and not rendered on the html page


Array.map() = always creates a new array to avoid mutation


Anti-Pattern = index as key in a looped element

  notes.map((note, index)=>... key={index})
  because "index" is not related to the data that the elements consume


always use Array.concat() for inserting arrays so it does not mutate state
